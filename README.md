# Movies-ETL
ETL Module, Amazing Prime Movie Analysis.
## Overview
- The purpose of this challenge was to extract, transform, and load a significant amount of data to prepare for a hackathon. The data came from Kaggle as well as a movies json document made up of information from wikipedia. We were to clean and parse the datasets, merge them into one entity, then load them into a SQL database.

## Summary
- This project used both functions and "regular expressions" to prepare the data for use. Preparing the kaggle dataset was a much simpler endeavor and required minor prep relative to its counterpart. The wikipedia json dataset was a far messier endeavor, but beared some fruit in the end. The Kaggle information made up the majority of the merged dataset, but the wikipedia dataset filled some holes.
